# Proposal submission website
This web application was developed for Dana Farber's Center for Genome Discovery (CCGD). CCGD provides technology platforms and robust data analysis tools to the research community. To help foster collaboration with researchers, CCGD had a proposal submission website for researchers to submit their proposals but it was out of date and not functioning properly. It was decided the proposal submission website needed to be redeveloped with additional features and improved ease of use.

## Features
The proposal submission website includes the following features:
* Multiple user roles with varying access privileges (submitter, lab staff, scientific advisor, faculty, administrator)
* Saving proposal drafts
* Creating committees of faculty and scientific advisors to review submitted proposals
* Voting mechanism where committees members can vote and leave comments on proposals
* Administrator interface that allows quick creation/modication/deletion of users, proposals, committees
* Password retrieval system

## Built with
* Ruby on Rails
* Rspec testing framework
* jQuery
* Bootstrap
