%h1 CCGD Policy Statement
%p The following policy statement reflects the approved operating policies and procedures established by the CCGD as summarized here and fully described in the CCGD Policies and Procedures. 
%h2 Article I: Approvals 
%p It is the responsibility of the collaborating investigator to obtain approval for participation in the proposed research from the appropriate institutional officials and/or committees at all sites at which data and samples being submitted to the CCGD were collected according to applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations and any relevant institutional policies. This specifically includes having the proper IRB approvals and patient consent, if necessary. 
%p Additionally, the collaborating investigator affirms that they will not provide the CCGD access to the identities of the donor-subjects or to information through which the identities of the donor-subjects could readily be ascertained. 
%h2 Article II: Data Release 
%p The CCGD recognizes that pre-publication genome sequence data is a unique and an essential research resource for scientists conducting genomic research. Data release plans for the CCGD will be based on the guiding principle that pre-publication genome sequence data should be released to the scientific community as soon as data becomes available. As such, should sequence data be produced in the course of a collaborative research project, it is understood that the pre-publication genome sequence data will be made freely and publicly available via deposition to the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), a publicly searchable federally funded database. This policy does not pertain to experimental data generated through other core facilities. These results will remain confidential. Pre-publication of the sequence data does not preclude CCGD collaborators the right and responsibility to publish the work in a peer-reviewed journal. 
%p We have an open release policy for genome discovery collaborations with the Broad Institute. Data access will be via a registration-dependent site. There will be no data release policy for information generated by other core facilities. All collaborator results are considered confidential. 
%h2 Article III: Authorship and Publications 
%p The expectation in all CCGD collaborations is authorship or acknowledgement on papers and presentations resulting from the collaboration. An exact agreement regarding authorship will be determined between the CCGD and collaborator according to accepted conventions for scientific publication and formalized in the CCGD Collaboration Agreement. 
%h2 Article IV: Intellectual Property 
%p All Intellectual Property and Patent issues resulting from collaboration with the CCGD will be governed by the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute's regulations.
